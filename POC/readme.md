# veri-cleanse proof of concepts
These are small projects meant to illustrate the incremental early steps necessary to build the fully featured device.

### POC #1
### POC #2
### POC #3

### POC #4 
* Goal: demonstrate the ability to trigger a soap dispenser
* Hardware: ESP32 connected to a servo activates a transient 6V current to the soap dispenser motor
  * Soldered two pairs of wires onto the main board of the soap dispenser: connected to motor and to the IR sensor.
